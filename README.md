<h1>SeasonalBite</h1>

<p>SeasonalBite is a .NET MAUI application designed to simplify seed sowing scheduling for gardeners. The app shows a simple list view with a grid display of seeds ready to sow based on the current month. The idea came from watching my dad struggle with old paper records and clunky websites.</p>
